# Intro
Never-red is a web application to monitor personal finances. 
It is a simple CRUD application written in Golang just out of personal interest and with no pretentions at all. 

## Why? 
Because I don't like the interface some banks offer to their clients to keep track of their finances, so I decided to build my own.

## Why Golang? 
Because I wanted to learn it. And because it's fun and I can ;)

## Why never-red? 
Because with help of this web app the hope is that my bank account will never be printed out in red colour.
